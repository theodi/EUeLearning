at The Open Data Institute Without a licence your data isn’t truly open. As well as making your data machine readable and published you need a licence that tells other people that they can access use and share your data. Without a licence that says these things your data isn't truly open. Without a licence, you're not giving permission for businesses, organisations and startups to innovate. By permitting anyone to use, access and share your data for a range of purposes, commercial and non-commercial, you are unlocking an enormous amount of innovation. You are providing them with certainty and permission to take risks and this is really important to guarantee the benefits of open data. For an open licence, the simpler the licence the better. Quite often we are talking about data that will be remixed, integrated with other datasets, so the simpler the licence for your data the easier it will be for the reuser to mix it with other datasets to create new products and services. The creative commons standard licences are a useful simple standard for licensing open data. The creative commons attribution licence is the one we recommend for publishers and individuals for their data. If you are a government or other organisation who can't use a standard licence like the creative commons licence, it's still useful to think about making it as simple and understandable as possible for the reuser. If you're a company, organisation or department with a commitment to publishing open data, sometimes you might have contractors providing services on your behalf. To ensure that the data that's been collected and used as part of these contracted services is also published as open data, you can include clauses to that effect in any contacts that you have with them. This is a nice way of seeing through the open data cycle and making sure that all of the data that's involved in the delivery of important services is publishedas open data where possible.
