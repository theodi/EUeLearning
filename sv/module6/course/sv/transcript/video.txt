So my name is Liz Carolan

and I’m the International Development Manager. So it’s probably best to avoid a narrow focus on the quantity of the data published and instead to think about three broader areas when we’re measuring success of initiatives. The first one is readiness. So, to what extent is there the capacity 

to take on this project, and to deliver it?

The second one is implementation so to what extent are the key datasets 

being published and made available?

and the third one is impact so, are we seeing some of the tangible real-world results of the project in the creation of new products 

new services, or new insights out in the world?

A demand-focused approach is one that prioritises the needs of data users over those of the data producer So it’s one which encourages, seeks out and responds to feedback and it’s one which judges itself on the quality of the outputs the quality of the impacts of the project and not on the quantity of data published. So key performance indicators help us to stay on track with the implementation of our initiative They help us to identify and communicate about our successes they help us flag up maybe areas where we need to put a little bit more investment and they help us to refocus if perhaps along the way we find that we’re over investing in one part of the implementation and ignoring other parts.
