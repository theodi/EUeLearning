I’m Dave Tarrant,

I’m the Trainer and Data Scientist here at the open data institute. So the five stars of linked open data is a guideline that measures how well data is integrated into the web It examines the technical usefulness of a dataset ranging from it being available online under an open licence, one star to being part of the web of data, five stars. Achieving open data can be done with the first star Beyond this there are different degrees of what makes open data useable Three stars represent the lowest common denominator of usable open data. The first star simply says that the data must be available under an open licence, no matter what the format for example a .pdf file on a website. The second star says that the data must be available at a highly reusable, structured and machine readable format so for example an excel file. For the third star, this highly reusable, structured and machine readable format must not be tied to a particular software package So the format itself, and the implementation must be open allowing people to implement new tools, new code, to read that format. The final two stars are not always appropriate and implementing these may sacrifice usability for technical excellence.
